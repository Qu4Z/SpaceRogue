ALERTS SUCK FOR FREQUENT EVENTS!

Goblins overwhelm players
	introduce goblins later	

People endlessly lazer goblins
	WONTFIX

People have trouble differentiating space from Lukas
	Fog of war

Can get stuck in space on goblin collision

Too hard
People don't play more than once

DONE
No one works out they can lazer
	Removed instructions for things the player can discover in-game
	Moved lazer instruction to top

Not sure what each character represents
	Added coloured legend

Players don't realize they can lazer
	Start in locked room

Players often get stuck in a pile of goblins
	LESS GOBLINS

Hanging off platforms is confusing
	repace invisible hanging off platforms with visible .s
	remove commas from large jump gaps to encourage jumping 

Alerts interrupt the flow of the game, forcing users to use the mouse
	Replace alerts with counter in parts legend

Space-walk is confusing
	Design levels so it's quite hard to fall off the map

Floating off the map isn't fun
	Can't steps off railings straight off the edge of the map
	Can throw yourself from far away

Hard to tell when you're in space walk mode
	Jet noise and music cues help

Random part locations are breaking the level design
	Remove random part systems
	Replace with manually placing parts
