What's the most fun for the least effort?
Implementing the verbs, the most cohesive actions/items(one with the most interesting interactions)
But with the least dependencies, eg: Not doors because they depend on air pressure/power 
Features that work well with what the game has currently, but don't require other new systems to exist, small steps

Lowest hanging fruit:
FOV:Blanking out inside of space stations, why? Because it adds the verb discover
Lasers: Adds the verb laser, produces interesting behaviour when combined with almost all other elements
Gold: Adds treasure, motivation etc.
Status window: Colour text is awesome

Characters defined by traits eg: Bounty Hunter:Gets gold for kiling enemies
, combination of character flavour text and difference in behaviour

Meta:
Unlock items, traits, areas after every game

Mouse as interface, but keyboard is the primary input method

LEVEL DESIGN
Small corridors: 2 high, 4 wide
Vents: 1 wide
Big room/Maze area
Space platforms, very open, small
Pokemon-style single doors to other platforms
5 space doors, 3 centre spaces without railings
Reveals around corners are awesome
Put doors in centre of walls
Square platforms make more sense, clear lines between space and platform
