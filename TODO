BUGS:
 - Architecture needs rethinking. Too many abstraction boundaries between classes and their parents.
 - Enemies can steer in space
 o Many characters can inhabit one tile
 - Enemies can trap you in space.
   - Fix by letting you push off people in space (grappling)

Features:
Prototype:
 o SPAAAAAACE!
 o Diagonal movement
 o Enemies
   o Some sort of common codebase, too. Like move()
	 - Better AI (Scatter mode? Depends on gameplay decisions...)
 - Shooting! Lasers! ZAP ZAP!
 - Field of View
 - Gold

If game is fun:
 - Destructable terrain
 - Air pressure     m (_ _) m
 - Status window
 - Brainstorm!

Thoughts on entities in the game: 
	The current core of an entity is which mode it is in
	Modes decide behaviour, how it draws, how it affects others
	Modes, imo, should be how we communicate between the behaviour and presentation layers
	The drawing layer decides how to present the current state of any object
	The logic layer decides how an object behaves given its state
