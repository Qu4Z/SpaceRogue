BUGS:
 - Lazers jump a square in their first move
 - Crashes surf sometimes
 - Architecture needs rethinking. Too many abstraction boundaries between classes and their parents.
 - Enemies can steer in space
 o Many characters can inhabit one tile
 - Enemies can trap you in space.
   - Fix by letting you push off people in space (grappling)

Features:
Prototype:
 o SPAAAAAACE!
 o Diagonal movement
 o Enemies
   o Some sort of common codebase, too. Like move()
   - Better AI (Scatter mode? Depends on gameplay decisions...)
 o Shooting! Lasers! ZAP ZAP!

 o Lasers destroy walls
   - Pushing of stunned enemies?
 - Field of View
   o Basic field of view
   - Differentiate between not visble, unseen and space
 - Flavour-y explainy command line text thing
 - Sound

 - Mouse controls, TBT hybrid-y thing
 - Splinter cell conviction type AI, attacks last seen position, player leaves a ghost, clear enemy LoS

If game is fun:
 - Lasers heat up walls, cool down over a couple of turns, break on second shot
 - Air pressure     m (_ _) m
 - Status window
 - Brainstorm!

Thoughts on entities in the game: 
	The current core of an entity is which mode it is in
	Modes decide behaviour, how it draws, how it affects others
	Modes, imo, should be how we communicate between the behaviour and presentation layers
	The drawing layer decides how to present the current state of any object
	The logic layer decides how an object behaves given its state

	Extract text, presentation in to resources
