BUGS:
 o Lazers jump a square in their first move
 - Architecture needs rethinking. Too many abstraction boundaries between classes and their parents.
 - You can stay still in space by firing constantly. You should slide whether or not you lazered this turn. 

WONTFIX
 - Crashes surf sometimes

Features:
Potential features
 - Better AI (Scatter mode? Depends on gameplay decisions...)
  - Splinter cell conviction type AI, attacks last seen position, player leaves a ghost, clear enemy LoS
 - Pushing of stunned enemies?
 - Status window for colour text
 - Mouse controls
 - Use a fancy scheduler so we can actually draw intermediate laser steps?

v1
 o SPAAAAAACE!

   o Some sort of common codebase, too. Like move()
 o Shooting! Lasers! ZAP ZAP!
 o Change the sprite of stunned enemies to be a countdown
 o Lasers destroy walls
   o Basic field of view

    oTransition sound
 o Suit Parts
   o Collecting all suit parts wins game
   o Suit parts are at spawned randomly

Thoughts on entities in the game: 
	The current core of an entity is which mode it is in
	Modes decide behaviour, how it draws, how it affects others
	Modes, imo, should be how we communicate between the behaviour and presentation layers
	The drawing layer decides how to present the current state of any object
	The logic layer decides how an object behaves given its state

	Extract text, presentation in to resources
